* [#250](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink-web-client/issues/250) Added support to group real time updates in fixed intervals.

    The settings page now allows to provide the interval in which the UI should get updated, making that happen at once, with all the updates that have happened during that interval.

### Added
* [#148](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink-web-client/issues/148) Added support for real-time updates when consuming a Shlink version that is integrated with a mercure hub server.

    The integration is transparent. When a server is opened, shlink-web-client will try to get the mercure info from it.

    * If it works, it will setup the necessary `EventSource`s, dispatching redux actions when an event is pushed, which will in turn update the UI.
    * If it fails, it will assume it is either not configured or not supported by the Shlink version.

* [#265](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink-web-client/issues/265) Updated tags section to allow displaying number of short URLs using every tag and number of visits for all short URLs using the tag.

    This will work only when using Shlink v2.2.0 or above. For previous versions, the tags page will continue behaving the same.

* [#261](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink-web-client/issues/261) Added new page to show visit stats by tag.

    This new page will return a "not found" error when the server is lower than v2.2.0, as older versions do not support fetching stats by tag.

* [#253](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink-web-client/issues/253) Created new settings page that will be used to define customizations in the app.

* [#149](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink-web-client/issues/149) and [#198](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink-web-client/issues/198) Added new line chart to visits and tags stats which displays amount of visits during selected time period, grouped by month, week, day or hour.

## [2.4.0] - 2020-04-10
### Added
* [#199](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink-web-client/issues/199) Added table to visits page which displays the information in a paginated, sortable and filterable list.

    It also supports selecting multiple visits in the table which makes the corresponding data to be highlighted in the visits charts.

* [#241](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink-web-client/issues/241) Added support to select charts bars in order to highlight related stats in other charts.

    It also selects the visits in the new table, and you can even combine a selection in the chart and in the table.

* [#213](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink-web-client/issues/213) The versions of both shlink-web-client and currently consumed Shlink server are now displayed in the footer.
* [#221](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink-web-client/issues/221) Improved how servers are handled, displaying meaningful errors when a not-found or a not-reachable server is tried to be loaded.
* [#226](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink-web-client/issues/226) Created servers can now be edited.
* [#234](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink-web-client/issues/234) Allowed short code length to be edited on any new short URL when using Shlink 2.1 or higher.
* [#235](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink-web-client/issues/235) Allowed editing the long URL for any existing short URL when suing Shlink 2.1 or higher.
